## Getting a Workstation

In order to maximize our time on becoming fluent in Chef, we are going to start with pre-configured student workstations. These workstations have all of our necessary tools installed with classroom customized configurations.  There is nothing special about these workstations other than the fact that they are going to save us time getting started.

We'll end today's lesson by having an Install Fest.  During that time we will learn about the underlying tools, setup procedures, and will have ample time to troubleshoot any installation issues you may be experiencing on your local workstation.

I will distribute publicly addressable system addresses with the user name and password required to access these machines.

We will spend the entire day on these machines developing chef code. At the end of the day I can assist anyone that needs help retrieving the code from this remote workstation.

Now that everyone has a workstation, I want describe what has been setup. You are using an Ubuntu 14.04 instance being hosted on EC2. This instance has a chef user which has been granted password-less sudoers access. The ChefDK is installed, Docker, and a plugin to all a testing tool in Chef work with Docker.
