## Getting a Workstation

In order to maximize our time on becoming fluent in Chef, we are going to start with pre-configured student workstations.  These workstations have all of our necessary tools installed with classroom customized configurations.  There is nothing special about these workstations other than the fact that they are going to save us time getting started.  Don't worry, we will circle back around and end Day 1 by setting up our own workstations from scratch.

We end today's lesson by having an Install Fest.  During that time we will learn about the underlying tools, setup procedures, and we will have ample time to troubleshoot any installation issues you may experience on your local workstation.

We cover the procedure for accessing remote workstations.

Once everyone is able to access their remote workstations, quickly cover a bullet point list of what's installed on these machines.
