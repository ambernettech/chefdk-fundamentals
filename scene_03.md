## Resources

Welcome to your new organization. The one that judged you on every line of your resumÃ© and scrutinized every answer. And look at the state of our operations. We can't even get our system configured and delivered to you. Well at least you have a system. It seems there is always a fight to requisition hardware. So lets count ourselves lucky and see if we fend for ourselves.

Well the first place to start is if you have our editor installed on that system. But which is your editor:

* Emacs
* Nano
* Vim

> TODO: A small description and section should be added for each of these editors

Great. Now that you've picked your editor, you need to find out if it is already installed. We can use the `which` command and ask the OS if it knows the text editors executable.

```
$ which emacs
$ which nano
$ which vim
```

It seems the system does not even have a proper editor installed. So it sounds like we have a little configuration left to do to make sure this workstation is ready.
